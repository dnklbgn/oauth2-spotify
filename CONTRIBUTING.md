# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

## Bug Report

We accept bug reports via issues created on [GitHub](https://github.com/dnklbgn/oauth2-spotify/issues).

### Prior to submitting your report

- __Always search the issue or pull request list first__ - The odds are good that if you've found a problem, someone else has found it, too.
- __Always try the [master branch](https://github.com/dnklbgn/oauth2-spotify)__ - to see if the reported bug has not already been fixed.

## Pull Request

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/dnklbgn/oauth2-spotify/pull).

- __[PSR-12 Coding Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)__ - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't pass the package coding style test suite.
- __Add tests!__ - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- __Document any change in behaviour__ - Make sure the README and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- __Consider our release cycle__ - We try to follow SemVer. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- __Create topic branches__ - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- __One pull request per feature__ - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- __Send coherent history__ - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

## Running Tests

```bash
$ composer run phpunit
```

__Happy coding__!
